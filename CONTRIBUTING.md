# Contributing to StellarYield

Thanks for contributing to StellarYield. This repository contains frontend, backend, and Soroban contract code, so each pull request should stay focused and include the verification steps for the area it touches.

## Before You Open a PR

- Claim or reference the GitHub issue you are working on.
- Keep the change scoped to one feature, fix, or documentation update.
- Run the checks for each package you modified.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.

## Local Verification

Use the quick commands in [README.md](./README.md), or follow the more detailed [Pre-commit Formatting and Verification Guide](./docs/contributor-guide.md).

Before opening a PR that touches the client, run these from `client/`:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint` (full local lint)
- `npm run lint:ci-scope` (matches CI lint scope)
- `npm run test:coverage`
- `npm run build`

Current CI lint scope is intentionally limited to `src/features/zap` via
`npm run lint:ci-scope`, while CI also enforces a full production build with
`npm run build` as a diagnostic step to surface TypeScript/Vite errors before
Vercel.

## Contract Security

Pull requests that touch `contracts/` must pass the checklist in
[docs/contract-security-checklist.md](./docs/contract-security-checklist.md)
before review. The checklist covers storage schema changes, authorization checks,
arithmetic safety, test coverage, and admin permission review.

## CI Failure Artifacts

If CI fails on your pull request, open the failed workflow run in GitHub Actions and check the **Artifacts** section. Frontend build logs, any generated frontend build output, and contract test logs are uploaded there for short-term debugging.

## Release Process

Maintainers should use the [Release Checklist](./docs/release-checklist.md) before and after merges that go to production.
